# About me üë©
My name is Natalia Jƒôcz and I'm 32 years old. I've been studying English Philology for five years and graduated with Master Degree. I've also gained Bachelor Degree at Managment in Public Administration. Since the beginning of my career, I've been occupied with working with children in the positions of teacher and entertainer. I am an enthusiastic team player with the experience of working in the international environments in many countries in Europe. For the last three years, I found my way back in Poland, where I've been developing my skills in IT industry as Quote and Configuration Specialist. Recently, I've started my interest in software testing and I continuously develop my skills to become a tester. 
Throughout my whole career, I've always been professional and passionate about what I've been doing. Thanks to my experience I learnt how important the high quality of service is. I enjoy learning new things and I'm always keen on making changes and improvements.
